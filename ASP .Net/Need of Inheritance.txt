DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself. It's a concept in programming that speaks about productivity, and readability. Inheritance reduces or eliminates the need for repeated 
code.

Complexity. OOP reduces the complexity of the code in a program (or at least, it should...). By using inheritance, your code is again, not repeated, and easier to 
decipher.

Maintenance. In maintaining a solution, inheritance helps out a great deal when implemented correctly.

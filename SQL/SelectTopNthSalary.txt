The following solution is for getting 6th highest salary from Employee table ,

SELECT TOP 1 salary

	SELECT DISTINCT TOP 6 salary
	FROM employee

ORDER BY salary

You can change and use it for getting nth highest salary from Employee table as follows

SELECT TOP 1 salary
FROM (
	SELECT DISTINCT TOP n salary
	FROM employee
	ORDER BY salary DESC) a
ORDER BY salary

where n > 1 (n is always greater than one)
-------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT MIN(Sal) FROM TableName
WHERE Sal IN
(SELECT TOP N Sal FROM TableName ORDER BY Sal DESC)

where n > 1 (n is always greater than one).
